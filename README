Identifies heteroplasmy in family trios - a mother, a father, and a single offspring.

write_basecall_files converts a folder of .bam files into a folder of .bc files.

.bc files represent reads at each locus of each base. This code is intended to replicate Mitoseek in Python.

Example:

python write_basecall_files -i bamfolder -o bcfolder -f lib/rcrs.fasta
