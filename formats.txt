lib/*.trios2:
unused_id     proband_stable_id       mother_stable_id        father_stable_id
        gender  proband_path    proband_file_id       dad_path        dad_file_id   
        mother_path        mother_file_id

Only the *_stable_id columns matter.

The "unused_id" column is not used for anything. It can be anything.

*_path columns are also not used and can be anything.

The bizarre format is due to writting the scripts to use input info files as-is.

Subsequent versions of this program will accept a simplified .trios file.

lib/*.map2:
stable_id	bc_filename

lib/*.path:
keyword	bam_folder	bc_folder	map_file	trios_file	hets_file	vcf_file

At present, only the first five columns are used.

Subsequent versions of this program will be simplified to not require this file.
